By Alex Hamedaninia

Link to javadoc start page:

Your full names
Each member’s contribution
A link to the Javadoc’s start page (index.html).
A link to your screencast on some video streaming website. The screen cast should introduce your names and demo run your code, and each person should talk about their code briefly. Please make it <3 minutes. (Hint: you can edit the video – concatenate/delete video sections.)
